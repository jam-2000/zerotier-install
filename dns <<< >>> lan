I'm having issues on well on Xubuntu 22 in combination with zerons.

When using dig the IP address of bobby.myztnework.com is correctly returned by the zerons server:

>> dig +short @10.147.20.10 bobby.myztnework.com
 10.147.20.202

However, when performing a ping


ping: bobby.myztnetwork.com: Name or service not known

Edit. Okay, got things working. laduke's comment guided the fix on my computer.

>>  sudo networkctl reload
WARNING: systemd-networkd is not running, output will be incomplete.

So, looks like systemd-networkd isn't working. Checking system status to confirm:

sudo  systemctl status systemd-networkd
○ systemd-networkd.service - Network Configuration
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
TriggeredBy: ○ systemd-networkd.socket
       Docs: man:systemd-networkd.service(8)

Let's try starting it to see what happens:

sudo systemctl start systemd-networkd
sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd

Now trying laduke's comments again

sudo networkctl reload
sudo networkctl reconfigure ztkseqpe62

No issues reported this time. Onto ping test:

PING bobby.myztnetwork.com (10.147.20.202) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from bobby.myztnetwork.com (10.147.20.202): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=82.4 ms
64 bytes from bobby.myztnetwork.com (10.147.20.202): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=31.8 ms

Problem solved! (at least on my end)
